# ChainLinkTravelsParcel
A parcel booking and delivery application where goods from distant cities can be transported through a chain of multiple travel services. Just like a relay system, a parcel can hop from one travel operator to another until it reaches the destination. This project focuses on building a seamless chain-based parcel booking and tracking solution for long-distance, bulky, or hard-to-ship items.


A parcel booking and delivery application where goods from distant cities can be transported through a **chain of multiple travel services**.  
Like a relay system, a parcel can hop from one travel operator to another until it safely reaches the destination.  

This project focuses on creating a **seamless chain-based parcel booking and tracking system** for long-distance, bulky, or hard-to-ship items.
