# ChainLinkTravelsParcel
A parcel booking app where goods from distant cities move through a chain of travel services. Like a relay, parcels hop from one operator to another until delivery. The project builds a seamless chain-based booking and tracking system for long-distance, bulky, or hard-to-ship items.
